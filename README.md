# Modified *Chicago Manual of Style* `csl`

Includes a `csl` file modifying the *Chicago Manual of Style* notes and bibliography style from the 18th edition as follows:

1. for books and articles and other published scholarly sources
  a. puts the preferred "shortened notes" form in the notes and
  b. puts the full citation in the bibliography BUT
2. for archival, newspaper, and other primary sources
  a. provides the full citation on the first instance in the notes and
  b. provides the shortened citation on subsequent instances in the notes and
  c. *omits* that item from the bibliography.
  
Rationale: I don't want to put every single primary-source item (letter, diary entry, newspaper article) separately in the bibliography, but prefer instead to name the collections consulted.
